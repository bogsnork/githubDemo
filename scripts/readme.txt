It is the best of times, 
it is the worst of times, 
it is the age of wisdom, 
it is the age of foolishness, 
it is the epoch of belief, 
it is the epoch of incredulity, 
it is the season of Light, 
it is the season of Darkness, 
it is the spring of hope, 
it is the winter of despair, 
we had everything before us, 
we had nothing before us, 
we are all going direct to Heaven, 
we are all going direct the other way 

– in short, the period is so far like the present period, 

that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, 

for good or for evil, 

in the superlative degree of comparison only.
